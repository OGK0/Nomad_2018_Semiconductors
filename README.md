Code for Kaggle Competition - Nomad 2018 Predicting Transparent Semiconductors

This is the code for the Kaggle Competition.

I've tried:
- Several Regression methods such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines and Elastic Net
- Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost / Gradient Boosting Machines)

Next Steps:
XGBoost (Boosted Decision Trees)
